# üñºÔ∏è Image Processing GUI

A simple, user-friendly MATLAB GUI for applying common image filters and effects. Built with MATLAB App Designer (single-app / modular code) to let you load images, preview edits in real-time, compare results, and save outputs.

Quick summary
- Platform: MATLAB (App Designer / .mlapp)  
- Purpose: interactively apply image-processing filters and export results  
- Ideal for: students, hobbyists, and prototyping image-processing pipelines üéì‚ú®

## Features ‚úÖ
- Load common image formats (PNG, JPG, BMP, TIFF)  
- Real-time preview of filters and parameter adjustments  
- Common filters: blur / Gaussian, sharpen, edge detection, contrast/histogram ops, morphological transforms, color adjustments üõ†Ô∏è  
- Side-by-side comparison (original vs. processed)  
- Save processed images (custom name & format)  
- Export or package as a standalone executable with MATLAB Compiler (optional)

---

## Requirements & dependencies ‚öôÔ∏è
- MATLAB R2019a or newer recommended (App Designer improvements after 2019)  
- Required MATLAB toolboxes (ensure these are installed and licensed):
  - Image Processing Toolbox (required) üß©
- Optional toolboxes (enable extra features):
  - Computer Vision Toolbox (optional ‚Äî extra filters & feature detectors)
  - Signal Processing Toolbox (optional ‚Äî advanced filter design)
- How to check installed toolboxes in MATLAB:
```matlab
ver
% or to test specifically:
license('test','Image_Toolbox')
```

---

## Installation & run ‚Äî quick steps ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1. Clone repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mayank-sethiya/Image-Processing-GUI.git
cd Image-Processing-GUI
```

2. Start MATLAB and add project folder to path:
```matlab
addpath(genpath('path/to/Image-Processing-GUI'))
```

3. Launch the app
- If there is an App Designer file (.mlapp):
  - Open in MATLAB App Designer and click "Run", or
  - From the MATLAB command window, run the generated app class (example):
    ```matlab
    % If the app class is named ImageProcessingApp:
    app = ImageProcessingApp; 
    ```
- If there's a helper launcher `main.m`:
```matlab
main
```

4. Use the GUI to load an image, choose filters, preview, and save the result.

---

## Typical user flow (what happens inside the app) üîÅ

1. Load image ‚Äî File ‚Üí Open (supported formats)  
2. Choose an effect/filter and adjust parameters (kernel size, strength, thresholds)  
3. Live preview updates the processed image pane  
4. Optionally compare with original using side-by-side or toggle view  
5. If satisfied, save/export processed image (choose format & location)  
6. (Optional) Export sequence of operations or batch-process multiple images

---

## Example usage snippets (MATLAB)
- Add repo to path and launch (command-line):
```matlab
addpath(genpath(pwd));
app = ImageProcessingApp;  % replace with your app's class name
```

- Apply a filter from command-line helper (example helper function):
```matlab
img = imread('input.jpg');
out = applyGaussian(img, 3, 1.5); % kernel size 3, sigma 1.5
imwrite(out, 'output.jpg');
```

---

## Exporting / Packaging (optional)
To create a standalone executable, use MATLAB Compiler (requires a license):
1. Open MATLAB ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Application Compiler
2. Select your `.mlapp` or `main.m` as entry point
3. Configure included files, runtime options, and build

---

## Troubleshooting & tips üõ†Ô∏è
- "App doesn't open": confirm you opened the `.mlapp` in App Designer or launched the correct class name.  
- "Missing functions / errors": ensure the project folder is on MATLAB path and dependencies (toolbox functions) are present.  
- "Slow preview with large images": downscale preview images for UI responsiveness; process full-resolution when saving.  
- "Export/compile failures": check MATLAB Compiler compatibility and include all helper .m files in the packaging step.
- Check MATLAB's command window and the app's status messages for diagnostic output.

---

## Tests & examples
- Include small example images in `assets/` and example scripts in `tests/` to demonstrate functionality and for automated checks.

---

## Contributing
- Good first contributions:
  - Add unit tests for helper functions
  - Add more filters and parameter presets
  - Improve UI accessibility and keyboard shortcuts
- Guidelines:
  - Fork ‚Üí branch ‚Üí PR
  - Keep UI changes backwards compatible
  - Document any new public helper functions in README or docs/

---

## Security & best practices üîê
- Do not commit large datasets or proprietary images ‚Äî keep sample images small.  
- Use `.gitignore` to avoid committing temporary/compiled or local preference files.
